"Enhanced Calculator Agent: Math Operations with GPT-4 in Jupyter"
The recent patch introduces a new Jupyter notebook file, 'better_calculator_agent.ipynb', which enhances the project's capabilities by incorporating functions for multiplication, addition, and squaring integers. This addition not only expands the project's functionality but also improves the user experience by simplifying the execution of mathematical tasks. Furthermore, the integration with the OpenAI model 'gpt-4' enables advanced interactions and detailed step-by-step demonstrations for various mathematical operations. Users can now benefit from a comprehensive tool that facilitates efficient and insightful calculations within the notebook environment.
